##  Experience

**Cybersecurity CTF Problemwriting** (2021-2024)

Primarily wrote binary exploitation challenges in C with Python pwntools test exploits. For PBjarCTF ([Github](https://github.com/pbjar)) and LITCTF ([Github](https://github.com/LEXMACS)) I taught proper contest organization and problem setup to teams involved and helped setup Google Cloud infrastructure. I also wrote for KQCTF ([Github](https://github.com/ZeroDayTea/kqctf)) and idekCTF ([Github](https://github.com/idekctf)). All these CTFs had over 500 teams and over $500 in prize money from sponsors. 

**USACO Tutoring** (2022-2023)

Independently tutored many students through online meetings to reach the highest levels of the USACO programming contest. Many students achieved highest division of Platinum, one student qualified for the Finalist Camp. 

## Projects
---

**Geoguess IRL Mobile App** ([Github](https://github.com/superj6/geoguess_irl))

Inspired by the game Geoguessr, a Flutter mobile app where within a radius of your gps location you are given a random image provided by Google Maps API and have to attempt to physically walk as close to the location as possible. Use a Nodejs server to store account information and look up other's stats.

**Autogen Geodash Desktop Game** ([Github](https://github.com/superj6/autogen-geodash))

A C++ OpenGL simplified version of the 2d game Geometry Dash that autogenerates level maps. During gameplay all possible upcoming player positions are simulated efficiently by storing a list of reachable frontier positions to ensure the level is always beatable.

**DNQ Attention RNN Translator** ([Github](https://github.com/superj6/dnq-attention))

Pytorch RNN model with attention for translating English to Spanish. Experimented with custom attention mechanism that queries relevant info by continually merging halves rather than comparing all terms at once.

**Popup Quiz Chrome Extension** ([Github](https://github.com/superj6/chrome-ext-quiz))

A Chrome extension that generates popup quizzes at random intervals based on flashcards sourced by user-provided quizlet links. To scrape links in the browser and work around CORS, I opened links in an iframe and inserted a content-script that scrapes flashcards and sends to a background worker. Published on Chrome Webstore.
